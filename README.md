This CSS-Animations are hover animations which you can use easy by adding the name of the
animation as class.

##How to use

```css
<div class="box rotate">
	text
</div>
```

In this example you will get the hover effekt 'rotate'.

For LESS you can include the file main.less in your document's <head>

```css
<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet/less" href="main.less">
</head>
```

For Stylus see on

and for SCSS see on
